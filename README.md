# 👋 Hi there, I’m Demi ／(･ × ･)＼

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
You’ve just discovered the secret lair of a code wizard, coffee enthusiast, and professional bug collector.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

- 💻 Full-stack developer by day, Pokémon trainer by night.
- ☕ Fueled by coffee, curiosity, and the occasional bug fix.
- 🌏 These days, I’m working remotely from Shanghai (shoutout to my company’s flexible policy!), but I usually call Philadelphia home.
- 🧩 Always up for a challenge—whether it’s solving puzzles, debugging mysterious errors, or building the next LEGO masterpiece.

## 🚀 My Superpowers

- 🔍 Spotting bugs in code (and sometimes in real life)
- ⚡ Turning caffeine into code that (usually) works
- 🧙‍♂️ Summoning obscure Stack Overflow answers at will
- 🕵️‍♂️ Master of the “it works on my machine” defense
- 🏆 Can name every Pokémon from memory (seriously, try me!)
- 🧸 Building epic LEGO creations and making my baby Rob laugh

## 📫 How to reach me

- 📬 [Email](mailto:czsy@msn.com) is the fastest way
- 🐱‍💻 Ping me on GitHub if you spot something cool
- 🦄 Telepathy hasn’t worked yet, but you’re welcome to try!

## ⚡ Fun fact

I’ve played every single version of Pokémon on Nintendo. If you ever need someone to name all 151 (or 800+) Pokémon, I’m your person. Gotta catch ’em all!
